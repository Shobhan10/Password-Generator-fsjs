# Password Generator

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Shobhan Sundar Goutam. This is a password generator app where random password will be generated with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols upto 20 characters. Also one can uncheck those that they don't need. Check it and get yourself a strong password. This is made with the help of `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`.
